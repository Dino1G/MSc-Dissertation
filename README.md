## Abstract

- Explores evolving patterns in A&E inpatient demographics and healthcare utilization in the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (WWL).
- Utilizes K-Prototypes clustering algorithm to examine Length of Stay (LoS) and identifies significant trends affecting healthcare delivery.
- Observes an increase in waiting times and LoS post-pandemic, with a stronger correlation between them.
- Patients tend to cluster around longer waiting times, posing challenges for emergency department throughput.
- Demographic shifts post-pandemic show an increase in average age and comorbidity scores.
- Shift in the dominant Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) Chapter suggests potential long-term effects of COVID-19.
- Calls into question the efficacy of existing acuity code systems and the need for further investigations into healthcare resource management.

# Introduction

## Company Background

- Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (WWL) is a medium-sized emergency and community foundation trust in Greater Manchester.
- WWL serves over 300,000 local residents and extends its expertise regionally, nationally, and internationally.
- The trust comprises multiple specialized medical centers with distinct healthcare domains.
- WWL operates within the framework of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but as an NHS Foundation Trust, it has a degree of financial and operational independence.

## Research Background

- Recent research at WWL indicates a shift in patient demographics since 2016, characterized by older patients with longer hospital stays.
- There's a notable increase in Length of Stay (LoS) across all age groups, particularly post-COVID-19.
- Extended LoS is associated with worse patient outcomes and increased demand for hospital beds.

## Aims and Objectives

- The primary aim is to examine factors influencing changes in patient Length of Stay (LoS) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Objectives:
  - Analyze patient characteristics and demographics to identify LoS trends.
  - Evaluate the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on LoS.
  - Use advanced clustering to categorize patients based on multiple variables.
  - Inform operational strategies to optimize bed capacity and patient outcomes in a post-pandemic environment.
